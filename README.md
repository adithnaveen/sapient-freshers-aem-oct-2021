## List of OOPS Concepts in Java 
- Inheritence 
- Encapulation
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism 

### JVM 
- - What is JVM 
- Change src to byte code 
- Platform independent 
- JDK VS JRE 
- in JRE you have JVM 
- JDK - Helps in compiling 

<hr/>


### Hello World Program 
```
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        int x=10; 
        boolean flag; 
        System.out.println("Hello");
        System.out.println(x);
        System.out.println(flag);
        hi();
    }

    void hi() {}
}
```


- C / C++ 
```
#DEFINE main hello
    int hello() {}


    void main() {}
```


### Platform Independence 
- Windows - Java -> .java -> .class -> jvm 
- Mac - Java -> .java -> .class -> jvm 
- Sun Solaris  - Java -> .java -> .class -> jvm 
- Linux - Java -> .java -> .class -> jvm 
- 






### Tools needed 
- We will use Java11 
- IDE - Eclipse, IntelliJ, VS Code, Net Beans

## Day 1 Agenda 
- Creating Classes in Java, 
- Working with Classes in Java, 
- Making methods and classes final, 
- OOPS- Inheritance,
- Overriding methods, 
- Packages -Package access
- Documentation comments,Â  

## List of OOPS Concepts in Java 
- Inheritence 
- Encapulation
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism 


### Usage of variables 
- packages - lower case (com.ps.beans, org.ps.controller)
- varaibles - camel case (empId, salaryDrawn, address, withDraw)
- method names - camel case (getEmpId(), withDrawSalary(), makePayment(), getDataFromServer())
- class names - pascal case (Employee.java, HelloWorld.java, SomeController.java)
- constants - uppercase - (PI, LOCATION, VERSION)
- +++ indentation 

- What is a class 
    - is blue print of the object, 
    - Every class shall have characteristics 
  
- What is a Object 
- What is instance variable 
<!-- - what is static variable 
- What is static method 
- what is static block  -->
- what is local variable 


class Employee {
    int empId; 
    String empName;
    float empSalary
    int empDept;
    int empAge;

    void hi() {
        int x; 
    }
}




Employee e; 
Employee e = new Employee(); 


- jar file is collection of class files + properties etc 
- java documentation to understand .jar content 
- WORM - Write Once Read Many 
- DRY - Dont Repeate Yourself 


### Access Specifiers 
- Encapulation
  - public 
  - private 
  - protected
  - default (package)
- keep all your variable private, you access it with getters / setters 

### Access Modifiers 
- final 
- static 
- synchronized 
- Abstract 



PS 
- Employee (name, salary, address) -> injected to the system -> (***) -> Employee Details + EmpId (static)


- Inheritence  (Parent - child )
  - is-a (extends)
    - Employee is a Person 
    - Human is a animal 
    - ProjectManager is a Employee 

    - In java only simple inhe, multi level inhe is possible 


    ```
        class Car {
            public void drive() {}
            prirvate void drive1() {}
        }
        class Maruti extends Car {
             public void drive() {}
             void drive1() {} (x) 
        }
        class Hyundai extends Car {}
    ```




  - has-a 
    - Car has a mirror 
    - Bike has a petrol tank 
    - Holds the reference of another object 


```
    class Employee  {
        private int empId; 
        private Name name; 
        private double salary; 
        private Address address; 
    }

    class Customer  {
        private int customId; 
        private Name name; 
        private double income; 
        private Address address; 
    }

    class Address  {
        private int hNo; 
        private String street; 
        private int pin;
        private String state; 
        private String city; 

    }   

    class Name {
        private String firstName; 
        private String lastName; 
    }


    Employee emp = new Employee(); 
    Name name = new Name(); 
    name.setFirstName("Ronak"); 
    name.setLastName("Parmar"); 
    ...
    emp.setName(name); 
    ...

```





- polymorphism 
   1. Compile time 
      1. with the help of overloading it is done either by  method or constructor 
      2. same method name diff signature 
      3. happens in same class
   2. Run time 
      1. Overriding with method only 
      2. same method name same signature 
      3. happens in different class provided they are inherited (parent - child )
   
<br >

- if you have the class marked as final then you cannot inherit 
- if you have method marked as final then you cannot override 
- if you have the method as private then you cannot override 
- if you have the method as static then inheritence is not supported 


final - class level, method level, for constants 

```

class Dad - final
    - work 


class son(you)
    - work @Override 
    - play 


class son(brother)
    - work 
    - trekking 
 
 Dad <-  son 
 son(brother) <- son(you)
```
