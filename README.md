## List of OOPS Concepts in Java 
- Inheritence 
- Encapulation
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism 

### JVM 
- - What is JVM 
- Change src to byte code 
- Platform independent 
- JDK VS JRE 
- in JRE you have JVM 
- JDK - Helps in compiling 

<hr/>


### Hello World Program 
```
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        int x=10; 
        boolean flag; 
        System.out.println("Hello");
        System.out.println(x);
        System.out.println(flag);
        hi();
    }

    void hi() {}
}
```


- C / C++ 
```
#DEFINE main hello
    int hello() {}


    void main() {}
```


### Platform Independence 
- Windows - Java -> .java -> .class -> jvm 
- Mac - Java -> .java -> .class -> jvm 
- Sun Solaris  - Java -> .java -> .class -> jvm 
- Linux - Java -> .java -> .class -> jvm 
- 






### Tools needed 
- We will use Java- - IDE - Eclipse, IntelliJ, VS Code, Net Beans

### Software List 
- https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/neon/3/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers
- https://git-scm.com/downloads
- https://code.visualstudio.com/download

## Day 1 Agenda 
- Creating Classes in Java, 
- Working with Classes in Java, 
- Making methods and classes final, 
- OOPS- Inheritance,
- Overriding methods, 
- Packages -Package access
- Documentation comments,Â  

## List of OOPS Concepts in Java 
- Inheritence 
- Encapulation
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism 


### Usage of variables 
- packages - lower case (com.ps.beans, org.ps.controller)
- varaibles - camel case (empId, salaryDrawn, address, withDraw)
- method names - camel case (getEmpId(), withDrawSalary(), makePayment(), getDataFromServer())
- class names - pascal case (Employee.java, HelloWorld.java, SomeController.java)
- constants - uppercase - (PI, LOCATION, VERSION)
- +++ indentation 

- What is a class 
    - is blue print of the object, 
    - Every class shall have characteristics 
  
- What is a Object 
- What is instance variable 
- what is static variable 
- What is static method 
- what is static block  
- what is local variable 


class Employee {
    int empId; 
    String empName;
    float empSalary
    int empDept;
    int empAge;

    void hi() {
        int x; 
    }
}




Employee e; 
Employee e = new Employee(); 


- jar file is collection of class files + properties etc 
- java documentation to understand .jar content 
- WORM - Write Once Read Many 
- DRY - Dont Repeate Yourself 


### Access Specifiers 
- Encapulation
  - public 
  - private 
  - protected
  - default (package)
- keep all your variable private, you access it with getters / setters 

### Access Modifiers 
- final 
- static 
- synchronized 
- Abstract 



PS 
- Employee (name, salary, address) -> injected to the system -> (***) -> Employee Details + EmpId (static)


- Inheritence  (Parent - child )
  - is-a (extends)
    - Employee is a Person 
    - Human is a animal 
    - ProjectManager is a Employee 

    - In java only simple inhe, multi level inhe is possible 


    ```
        class Car {
            public void drive() {}
            prirvate void drive1() {}
        }
        class Maruti extends Car {
             public void drive() {}
             void drive1() {} (x) 
        }
        class Hyundai extends Car {}
    ```




  - has-a 
    - Car has a mirror 
    - Bike has a petrol tank 
    - Holds the reference of another object 


```
    class Employee  {
        private int empId; 
        private Name name; 
        private double salary; 
        private Address address; 
    }

    class Customer  {
        private int customId; 
        private Name name; 
        private double income; 
        private Address address; 
    }

    class Address  {
        private int hNo; 
        private String street; 
        private int pin;
        private String state; 
        private String city; 

    }   

    class Name {
        private String firstName; 
        private String lastName; 
    }


    Employee emp = new Employee(); 
    Name name = new Name(); 
    name.setFirstName("Ronak"); 
    name.setLastName("Parmar"); 
    ...
    emp.setName(name); 
    ...

```





- polymorphism 
   1. Compile time 
      1. with the help of overloading it is done either by  method or constructor 
      2. same method name diff signature 
      3. happens in same class
   2. Run time 
      1. Overriding with method only 
      2. same method name same signature 
      3. happens in different class provided they are inherited (parent - child )
   
<br >

- if you have the class marked as final then you cannot inherit 
- if you have method marked as final then you cannot override 
- if you have the method as private then you cannot override 
- if you have the method as static then inheritence is not supported 


final - class level, method level, for constants 

```

class Dad - final
    - work 


class son(you)
    - work @Override 
    - play 


class son(brother)
    - work 
    - trekking 
 
 Dad <-  son 
 son(brother) <- son(you)
```



## Assignment 
```
    class Car {
        public void move() {
            System.out.println("Moves car"); 
        }
    }

    class SUV extends Car {
        boolean fourWheelDrive() {
            return true; 
        }
    }
    class HatchBack extends Car {
        public int fuelCapacity() {
            // generate random number (20-40)
            return the value 
        }
    }

    class Maruti extends SUV {
        // have few more methods
    }
    ... 

    class Maruti extends HatchBack {

    }
    

    class Client {
        public static void main(String [] args) {
            
        }
    }
```


# Day2 

- retro 
- how jar works 



## Agenda 
- Exception Handling and Assertions
- Exception handling with try-throw-catch-finally construct	
- Reference Types and Threading, 
- Working with types: Wrapper classes 




## List of OOPS Concepts in Java 
- [x] Inheritence 
- [x] Encapulation
- [x] Abstraction
- [x] Polymorphism 

- draw a car 


```
    abstract class Vehicle {
        public abstract void move();
    }
    abstract class Car extends Vehicle  {
        public abstract void steering();
        public void doors() {
            // all cars will have 4 doors 
        }
    }
    class Maruti extends Car {
        + Overriden Method move()
        public void abs() {}
    }
    class BMW extends Car {
        + Overriden Method move()
        public void airBags() {}
    }
```


## Abstraction 
- if you have a abstract method in the class it should be marked with ; 
- if you have atleast 1 abstract method then the class has to be marked as abstract
- if you have the abstract class then you cannot create an object (instantiate), but remember you can hold reference 
  - Car c; 
- if you have a abstract class which extends abstract class then having the implementation is optional 
- if you have any class which extends abstract class then the abstract mehtods should be overrident MANDATORY 
- an abstract class can have mix of abstract methods and concrete methods 

## Exception 

- if you have unchecked exception then you dont have to handle it explictily, JVM will take care by default 
- try - catch 
- try - catch catch 
- try - catch (specific) catch (specific) catch (generic)
- try - try - catch - try - catch 
- try - catch - finally 
- try - finally 
- try - catch -fianlly - try -catch 



### custom exception 
Salary - IT Return - declares some min salary limit - thorw some exception 
    - SalaryImproperException 
    - NameTooShortException 

throw - you can throw only 1 exception, is at statement level, your exception or java's exception 
throws - you can throw multiple, is at method level, your exception or java's exception 


## Interface's 
- Java support multiple inheritence with interfaces only 
- you can have a class implmenting more than 1 interfaces 
- an interface can extend 1 or more interfaces 
- an interface is 100% abstract 
- an interface is declared with keyword interface 
- an interface has nothing to do with object class 
- in interface the only access specifier is public 
- in interface you cannot have variables > final, static 


```
    interface Car {
        move(); 
    }
    interface IndianStandard {
        tyreMinSize();
    }
    interface KarnatakaStandara extends IndianStandard {

    }

    // the class implementing the interface have to override 
    // the mehtods which are in interface 
    class Maruti implements Car, IndianStandard {
        
    }
```


| Abstract Classes              | Interface                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Class                         | Interface                       |
| Multi level                   | Multiple                        |
| extends                       | implements                      |
| has reference to object class | Nothing to do with Object class |
| can have concrete mehtod      | 100% abstract                   |
| you can have variables        | no variables here               |




- why are we using wrapper class why not type casting 
  - it gets associated with class 
  - from converting from one object to another object 
    ```
        int x=10; 
        double d = x; 
        short s = (short) d; 
    ```

- it cannot be directly stored in to secodary device (serialize)
- collection & generics they dont support primititve 
- to support java.util packages 
- one int x  -> two  


## Threads 

| Process                  | Threads                          |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| OS Concept               | Programming concept              |
| Java, MS Word, Excel etc | main, T1-ronak, T2-ashotosh etc  |
| all controlled by OS     | Controlled by Developer          |
| priority managed by OS   | You can set  Min 1 Max 10 Norm 5 |


### Creating a thread 
1. Extend a class with Thread class 
2. Implmenting an interface Runnable (run)

            Thread t = new Runnable() {
                public void run() {

    interface Runnable {
        public void run();
    }


 class MyClass {
        public static void main(String args[]) {
            Thread t =  () -> {// blah blah... };
            }
        }
    }

```

Hi -> BYE 


- consice 
- Increses the readability 
- reduces boiler plate code 
- it encourages funcational programming -> async 
- The jar file when we build will be compact 
- Code reuse etc... 


https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/126

```
    public void add(int x, int y) {
        return x +y 
    }

    ... 
    int res = add(10, 20); 

    int res = (x, y) -> x + y; 

```

- if an interface has 1 mehtod then it is called as funcationa interface

    - in method reference way 
		accountList.sort(Comparator.comparing(Account:: getCustName));

- chararectistics of algorithm 
  - input - 0 or 1 or more 
  - output - atleast 1 
  - definiteness - if you can solve your computer should solve 
  - finiteness- surity of output, number of steps / duration (never web server / db server)
  - effectiveness - every statement should be effectived 

- how do you measure/analyze your algorithm 
  - time complexity - BigO notation / is for piece of code which may be converted in to program 
    - Network complexity - 5g edge computing 
    - Power - mobile / laptops 
    - CPU Registers - Device Driver applications 
  - space complexity 



- Anti Pattern 
- SOLID 


int *p = (*int) malloc(100); 
// do something 
free(p)


// to solve dictionary 
- list 
- set 
- map
  - hash - OLTP
  - tree - OLAP




- For writing algoritm you need have knowlege about OS, Processor how it works etc 

// ms, s, m, h, d, m-ms, 
for(int i=0; i<10; i++) {
    // do something 
}



-- to calculate time complextity 

> for(i=0; i<n; i++) = O(n)
> for(i=0; i<n; i+=2) = O(n)
> for(i=n; i>0; i--) = O(n)
> for(i=1; i<n; i*=2) = O(log 2 n) 
> for(i=1; i<n; i*=3) = O(log 3 n)

## Project Statement 
-  Practices 
   -  You have write developer documenation  
   -  to create a branch and then code and merge before than you have to raise the PR 
   -  make the application as cohesive as posissble 
   -  user Reader / Writer Classes 
   -  check if you can use properties files for getting details like 
      -  Company Name 
      -  Company Address 
      -  etc... 
-  output 
-  the application is CLI 
   -  Options
   -  1. Registration 
   -  2. Login 
   -  choose option : 1 
      -  welcome to registration 
         -  Enter useraname: ...... (but validate that the same username does not exist)
         -  Enter password:.......  
         -  Confirm Password: ..........
         -  Enter Email: ..... (validate the email ex: name@something.com - format to be validate)
         -  <Enter>
      -  if data goes well then save the record into th file and given Ack 
         -  CONGRATS USER CREATED: username 
      -  if there is an error show appropriate error message 
   -  Choose Option: 2 
      -  Enter user username : username <username> <enter>
      -  Enter password : password <password> <enter>
   -  based on the value which is passed validate and show appropriate message 
   -  if fails then 
      -  SORRY INVALID CREDENTIALS 
   -  if good then 
      -  Welcome User <Username> - Company Name : Sapient 
      -  Items (10, press next, 11-20, )
      -  ------------------- 
        - 1. Pizza - INR: 100 
        - 2. Idly - INR : 20 
        - 3. Roti Curry - INR 30 
        - ..... 
      - Chooose below option 
        - 1. Select the number to add to your cart (maintain a MAP<String, List<Item>>)
        - 2. 0 to go back to home screen 
        - 3. 99 View your cart 
        - 4. 100 to checkout 
 - When the demo is shown on monday 
   - the code should be in .jar file 
   - you have to execute like java -cp com.sapient.main

    <url-pattern>/hi</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>

```


- req.getparameter 
- resp.sendredirect
- you put buiness logic 
- out.println 
- you are handing req, res 
- out object 
- you have to handle exception 
- any changes to servlet need the server to be restarted 
- Servlet is Class - You write html code out.println("<h1>code</h1>"); 
- JSp is HTML <html> <body><p> <%%> </p></body></html> - in this you can put Java 
- when the changes are made to jsp then the server need not be started 
- when you write jsp then the servlet is created, that servlet is converted to java code then compiled to .class file 
  - and then loaded to servlet container 


-JSP 
    - <% %> - scriptlet 
    - <%= %> - is called expression is used only to substitute the values (no ;)
    - <%! %> - declaration - you can write some method or _jspInit(), _jspDestroy()
    - <%@ %> - directive - include external resources 


-html 
    - can have only static content 
      - h1, form, table, css etc 


- in jsp you should not ideally have scriptlets 
  - EL - Expression Language 
  - Tags - Custom Tags / JSTL Tags 

Introduce a arch called MVC 



JSTL - library - java standard tag library 
standard - which gives the implementation of JSTL lib

---------------------- 
1. DB - is this up 
   1. user - userid, username, userpassword, dob 
   2. restaurant - restid, restname, location etc 
2. you have write CRUD operation with User 
   1. registerUser(User user)
   2. login(login)
   3. insertRestaurant(Restaurant rest)
   4. getRestaurant(restId)...
3. write the test case 
4. create a maven project - for maven-archetype-webapp
5. create servlet to talk to JDBC Code which you have written 
   1. make 1 method - by ashotosh 
   2. make 1 method - by rishab 
6. jsp - your request comes from html / to display use JSP

Java Best Practices: Overview
1. Use Proper Naming Conventions
2. Class Members must be accessed privately
3. Use Underscores in lengthy Numeric Literals
4. Never leave a Catch Blocks empty
5. Use StringBuilder or StringBuffer for String Concatenation 
6. Avoid Redundant Initializations
7. Using enhanced for loops instead of for loops with counter
8. Proper handling of Null Pointer Exceptions
9. Float or Double: the right choice?
10. Use of single quotes and double quotes
11. Avoiding Memory leaks
12. Return Empty Collections instead of returning Null elements
13. Efficient use of Strings
14. Unnecessary Objects Creation
15. Proper Commenting"

# Day 16 
--- 
0. checkin your code 
1. validation
   1. Why
   2. How   - some framework - why not regex ->  empName [a-zA-Z+] or [a-zA-Z]{4,10} - JPA / Hibernate Validation framework 
2. loggers - no system.out.println 
3. code quality 
4. In eclipse we should have sonarlint 
5. We gonna create a service layer code to validate PT 1 
6. Install PMD and/or CheckStyle - Cyclomatic Complexity 
7. pointers of good programming practices 
   1. use builder pattern instead of creating an object when it huge 
   2. try using try-with instead of try-catch-finally 
   3. dont declare public varilables instead of public / protected getters / setters 
   4. try not using System.gc() 
   5. every bean should have toString 
   6. when you use hashcode then use equals also 
   7. consider to have static factory instead of public constructors 
   8. prefer to have comparator instead of comparable 
   
   class String implements Serializable, Comparable<String> {

       @Overriden 
       public void compareTo(String s) {
           // lexographical Check 
       }
   }

```

   class Employee implements Serializable, Comparable<String> {

       @Overriden 
       public void compareTo(String s) {
           // lexographical Check 
       }
   }

    class EmployeeSorter  {
        public List<Employee> sortNameAscending(List<Employee> employees) {
            new Comparator() {
                public int compare(String s1, String s2) {
                    return s1.compareTo(s2); 
                }
            }
         }

            public List<Employee> sortNameDescending(List<Employee> employees) {
             
            Comparator<String>  ascendingByName = (s1, s2) -> s2.compareTo(s1); 
            Collections.Sort(employees,ascendingByName ); 
         }
    }
```


   9.  use bounded wildcard chars for API 
   10. dont pass null to any method 
   11. avoid using e.printStackTracke() in catch block if needed 
       1.  try {}catch(Exception1 | Exception2 ignore ) {}
   12. use camelCasing - methods and variables 
       1.  pascal casing for class 
       2.  upper case for constants / enums 
       3.  lower case for packages 
   13. have meaning ful variables and commentds 
   14. dont return null instead of that return empty list 
   15. Give meaning full message for exception, make sure you handle that in Custom Exception 
   16. Use Composition(horizontal) Over Inheritenace (Vertical)
   17. Use interface instead of asbtract class so that it give you opportunity in future 
   18. Use lambda where ever possible (Ex Stream) for iteration 
   19. use enums instead of declaring constants in Class / Interface 
   20. hold reference of the interface and create an object of the class rather to have the 
         reference of the class Ex: ICustomerDao dao = new CustomerDao(); 



public void hi(String name) {
    if(name.length <10) {
        return "No Name";   - 1 path 
    }else {
        return "hi "+ name; - 1 Path 
    }
}





Violation 
- Declaring Public variable 
- Variables should always be in camelCase 
- avoid to have try catch finally instead have try-with-catch 
- 



[a-zA-Z+] 

String empName = "Hemanth1"; 
String regExValues = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";

boolean flag = false; 
for(i=0; i<empName.length; i++) {
       if(!empName.charAt(i).contains(regExValues)){
           flag = false; 
       }
    
}

if(!flag) {
    sorry invalid name 
}


What is builder Class 

```
    class Employee {
        private int empId;
        private String empName; 
        private boolean isMarried; 
        .... 30 
        private double salary; 
    }


    Employee emp = new Employee(); 
    emp.setxxx... 

```



  ServiceRegistry serviceRegistry = new StandardServiceRegistryBuilder()
                    .applySettings(configuration.getProperties())
                    .build();



```
    abstract class Company  {
        private Company(){}
        public static Company getCompany(String companyName) {
            if(companyName.equals("infy)) {
                return new Infosys(); 
            }else if(companyName.equals("wipro")) {
                return new Wipro(); 
            }else if(companyName.equals("ManipalInfossy")) {
                return new ManipalIfnfosys();
            }

            return null; 
        }
        void solution(); 
    }
    class Infosys  extends Company {
        public void solution(){}        
    }
    class Wipro Infosys  extends Company {
        public void solution(){}
    }
    class ManipalInfosys  extends Company  {
        public void solution(){}
    }
 
    Company company = Company.getCompany("ManipalInfosys"); 


```

Solid Principles	


SOLID Principles, Checking Code quality with right tool -sonarqube
â¢	Single-responsibility principle
â¢	Openâclosed principle
â¢	Liskov substitution principle
â¢	Interface segregation principle
â¢	Dependency inversion principle

Introduction to cyclometric complexity 


- SonarQube - 9000
1. Linting - Sonar / ES 
   1. effectively using variable 
   2. effectively using try catch 
   3. effectively using comments 
   4. effectively using parameters 
   5. effectively using resouces... 
2. if you have BL 
   1. should be tested 
3. bugs 
4. hotspots etc 
5. appxoimate time to fix above points (debt)
6. maven project 


mvn sonar:sonar \
  -Dsonar.projectKey=java-works \

1. SOLID 
   1. S - Single Responsibility Principle 
   2. O - Open Close Principle 
   3. L - Functions that use pointers or references t base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.
   4. I - Interface Segregation Principle 
   5. D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DI / IOC)
2. Design Patterns 
3. Anti Pattern (Break that in to smaller pieces)
