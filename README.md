## List of OOPS Concepts in Java 
- Inheritence 
- Encapulation
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism 

### JVM 
- - What is JVM 
- Change src to byte code 
- Platform independent 
- JDK VS JRE 
- in JRE you have JVM 
- JDK - Helps in compiling 

<hr/>


### Hello World Program 
```
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        int x=10; 
        boolean flag; 
        System.out.println("Hello");
        System.out.println(x);
        System.out.println(flag);
        hi();
    }

    void hi() {}
}
```


- C / C++ 
```
#DEFINE main hello
    int hello() {}


    void main() {}
```


### Platform Independence 
- Windows - Java -> .java -> .class -> jvm 
- Mac - Java -> .java -> .class -> jvm 
- Sun Solaris  - Java -> .java -> .class -> jvm 
- Linux - Java -> .java -> .class -> jvm 
- 






### Tools needed 
- We will use Java11 
- IDE - Eclipse, IntelliJ, VS Code, Net Beans

## Day 1 Agenda 
- Creating Classes in Java, 
- Working with Classes in Java, 
- Making methods and classes final, 
- OOPS- Inheritance,
- Overriding methods, 
- Packages -Package access
- Documentation comments,Â  

## List of OOPS Concepts in Java 
- Inheritence 
- Encapulation
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism 


### Usage of variables 
- packages - lower case (com.ps.beans, org.ps.controller)
- varaibles - camel case (empId, salaryDrawn, address, withDraw)
- method names - camel case (getEmpId(), withDrawSalary(), makePayment(), getDataFromServer())
- class names - pascal case (Employee.java, HelloWorld.java, SomeController.java)
- constants - uppercase - (PI, LOCATION, VERSION)
- +++ indentation 

- What is a class 
    - is blue print of the object, 
    - Every class shall have characteristics 
  
- What is a Object 
- What is instance variable 
- what is static variable 
- What is static method 
- what is static block  
- what is local variable 


class Employee {
    int empId; 
    String empName;
    float empSalary
    int empDept;
    int empAge;

    void hi() {
        int x; 
    }
}




Employee e; 
Employee e = new Employee(); 


- jar file is collection of class files + properties etc 
- java documentation to understand .jar content 
- WORM - Write Once Read Many 
- DRY - Dont Repeate Yourself 


### Access Specifiers 
- Encapulation
  - public 
  - private 
  - protected
  - default (package)
- keep all your variable private, you access it with getters / setters 

### Access Modifiers 
- final 
- static 
- synchronized 
- Abstract 



PS 
- Employee (name, salary, address) -> injected to the system -> (***) -> Employee Details + EmpId (static)


- Inheritence  (Parent - child )
  - is-a (extends)
    - Employee is a Person 
    - Human is a animal 
    - ProjectManager is a Employee 

    - In java only simple inhe, multi level inhe is possible 


    ```
        class Car {
            public void drive() {}
            prirvate void drive1() {}
        }
        class Maruti extends Car {
             public void drive() {}
             void drive1() {} (x) 
        }
        class Hyundai extends Car {}
    ```




  - has-a 
    - Car has a mirror 
    - Bike has a petrol tank 
    - Holds the reference of another object 


```
    class Employee  {
        private int empId; 
        private Name name; 
        private double salary; 
        private Address address; 
    }

    class Customer  {
        private int customId; 
        private Name name; 
        private double income; 
        private Address address; 
    }

    class Address  {
        private int hNo; 
        private String street; 
        private int pin;
        private String state; 
        private String city; 

    }   

    class Name {
        private String firstName; 
        private String lastName; 
    }


    Employee emp = new Employee(); 
    Name name = new Name(); 
    name.setFirstName("Ronak"); 
    name.setLastName("Parmar"); 
    ...
    emp.setName(name); 
    ...

```





- polymorphism 
   1. Compile time 
      1. with the help of overloading it is done either by  method or constructor 
      2. same method name diff signature 
      3. happens in same class
   2. Run time 
      1. Overriding with method only 
      2. same method name same signature 
      3. happens in different class provided they are inherited (parent - child )
   
<br >

- if you have the class marked as final then you cannot inherit 
- if you have method marked as final then you cannot override 
- if you have the method as private then you cannot override 
- if you have the method as static then inheritence is not supported 


final - class level, method level, for constants 

```

class Dad - final
    - work 


class son(you)
    - work @Override 
    - play 


class son(brother)
    - work 
    - trekking 
 
 Dad <-  son 
 son(brother) <- son(you)
```



## Assignment 
```
    class Car {
        public void move() {
            System.out.println("Moves car"); 
        }
    }

    class SUV extends Car {
        boolean fourWheelDrive() {
            return true; 
        }
    }
    class HatchBack extends Car {
        public int fuelCapacity() {
            // generate random number (20-40)
            return the value 
        }
    }

    class Maruti extends SUV {
        // have few more methods
    }
    ... 

    class Maruti extends HatchBack {

    }
    

    class Client {
        public static void main(String [] args) {
            
        }
    }
```


# Day2 

- retro 
- how jar works 



## Agenda 
- Exception Handling and Assertions
- Exception handling with try-throw-catch-finally construct	
- Reference Types and Threading, 
- Working with types: Wrapper classes 




## List of OOPS Concepts in Java 
- [x] Inheritence 
- [x] Encapulation
- [x] Abstraction
- [x] Polymorphism 

- draw a car 


```
    abstract class Vehicle {
        public abstract void move();
    }
    abstract class Car extends Vehicle  {
        public abstract void steering();
        public void doors() {
            // all cars will have 4 doors 
        }
    }
    class Maruti extends Car {
        + Overriden Method move()
        public void abs() {}
    }
    class BMW extends Car {
        + Overriden Method move()
        public void airBags() {}
    }
```


## Abstraction 
- if you have a abstract method in the class it should be marked with ; 
- if you have atleast 1 abstract method then the class has to be marked as abstract
- if you have the abstract class then you cannot create an object (instantiate), but remember you can hold reference 
  - Car c; 
- if you have a abstract class which extends abstract class then having the implementation is optional 
- if you have any class which extends abstract class then the abstract mehtods should be overrident MANDATORY 
- an abstract class can have mix of abstract methods and concrete methods 

## Exception 

- if you have unchecked exception then you dont have to handle it explictily, JVM will take care by default 
- try - catch 
- try - catch catch 
- try - catch (specific) catch (specific) catch (generic)
- try - try - catch - try - catch 
- try - catch - finally 
- try - finally 
- try - catch -fianlly - try -catch 



### custom exception 
Salary - IT Return - declares some min salary limit - thorw some exception 
    - SalaryImproperException 
    - NameTooShortException 

throw - you can throw only 1 exception, is at statement level, your exception or java's exception 
throws - you can throw multiple, is at method level, your exception or java's exception 


## Interface's 
- Java support multiple inheritence with interfaces only 
- you can have a class implmenting more than 1 interfaces 
- an interface can extend 1 or more interfaces 
- an interface is 100% abstract 
- an interface is declared with keyword interface 
- an interface has nothing to do with object class 
- in interface the only access specifier is public 
- in interface you cannot have variables > final, static 


```
    interface Car {
        move(); 
    }
    interface IndianStandard {
        tyreMinSize();
    }
    interface KarnatakaStandara extends IndianStandard {

    }

    // the class implementing the interface have to override 
    // the mehtods which are in interface 
    class Maruti implements Car, IndianStandard {
        
    }
```


| Abstract Classes              | Interface                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Class                         | Interface                       |
| Multi level                   | Multiple                        |
| extends                       | implements                      |
| has reference to object class | Nothing to do with Object class |
| can have concrete mehtod      | 100% abstract                   |
| you can have variables        | no variables here               |




- why are we using wrapper class why not type casting 
  - it gets associated with class 
  - from converting from one object to another object 
    ```
        int x=10; 
        double d = x; 
        short s = (short) d; 
    ```

- it cannot be directly stored in to secodary device (serialize)
- collection & generics they dont support primititve 
- to support java.util packages 
- one int x  -> two  


## Threads 

| Process                  | Threads                          |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| OS Concept               | Programming concept              |
| Java, MS Word, Excel etc | main, T1-ronak, T2-ashotosh etc  |
| all controlled by OS     | Controlled by Developer          |
| priority managed by OS   | You can set  Min 1 Max 10 Norm 5 |


### Creating a thread 
1. Extend a class with Thread class 
2. Implmenting an interface Runnable (run)
